			<p>The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves.</p>

			<p>The dodo bird was native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Although this flightless bird had no natural predators, Dutch settlers hunted it to extinction, and it disappeared in approximately 1662.Because there were no reptiles, mammals or other predators on Mauritius, dodos never developed natural defences. When settlers arrived, the dodos readily approached them and the animals they brought with them. In addition, dodos laid only one egg at a time. </p>

			<h3>What did they eat?</h3>

			<div class= "container3">
			<p>In addition to fallen fruits, the dodo probably subsisted on nuts, seeds, bulbs, and roots. It has also been suggested that the dodo might have eaten crabs and shellfish, like their relatives the crowned pigeons.Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys. The dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season.</p>

			<h4>When were they discovered?</h4>

			<div class= "container2">
			<p>The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered it to be a mythical creature. The dodo was also kind and was seen as a source of ready-to-eat food.</p>

			<h5>What was their appearance?</h5>
			<img src= "img/Dodobird_physique.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;float: right;">
			<div class= "container3">
			<p>Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.6–21.1 kg (23–47 lb). The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Because these vary considerably, and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. </p>
